Consisting of projects I have completed in an introdcutory HCI course as well as projects I have started and worked on within Pedro Lopes' HCI Lab at UChicago. 

Projects within the class consist of 

  - making a latency test within terminal to evaluate Fitt's law principles
  - a game of pong which can be played hand and eyes free, the controller is moved with voice input and the loaction of the paddle is signaled by pitch         output
  - a 3D printed finger extension that is compatible with smart deveices (it conducts enough charge to interact with capacitive screens)
  - a redesign of Chicago transit signs to give more clarity on train arrival/departure, emergencies, direction, delays
  - Protyping and design of a 3D contoller interface meant to be used along with a VR UI system that would indicate oxygen, depth, battery, and radar for a     scuba-diving system

Projects within the lab consist of 
  - assisting with the user studies of several projects, such as HANDMORPH
  - starting my own project evaluating the effect of electrical muscle stimulation on enhancing the learning of different polyrhythms
